# -Iris-Flower-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
A beginner-friendly machine learning project to classify Iris flower species using sepal and petal dimensions. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and visualized with Matplotlib &amp; Seaborn. Ideal for learning data preprocessing, EDA, and classification modeling.
# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the classification of Iris flower species using a supervised machine learning model. It utilizes the classic Iris dataset, which contains 150 records of three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) and four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset used is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset).

| Feature         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Sepal Length   | Length of the sepal in cm |
| Sepal Width    | Width of the sepal in cm |
| Petal Length   | Length of the petal in cm |
| Petal Width    | Width of the petal in cm |
| Species        | Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica |
